In September 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49085346) the claim that a "quiet green tax" was deterring gardeners from recycling their waste.

Analysis showed some UK councils were charging up to £100 a year for a kerbside collection, despite one in four councils providing a free service.

Critics said the service should be free to residents to reduce the amount of clippings being sent to landfill.

Councils said the service was not statutory and home composting was a cheaper alternative.

The BBC's Shared Data Unit looked at the annual subscription charges levied by local councils for regular kerbside garden waste collections. It found:

- More than 140 local authorities provided a free collection, but charges for other councils ranged from £18 to £96.
- The average annual charge was around £31, with higher costs levied in London and the South East.
